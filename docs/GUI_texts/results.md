# Result Processing
The result processing shows the results of the optimization. A 
differentiation is made between a single-objective optimization (1) and a 
multi-objective optimization (2). Depending on the type of optimization, the 
result preparation differs. 
1. In single-objective optimization, the following results are displayed:
    - Result Overviews: Overview of costs, emissions, and energy demand of the 
    investigated energy system / area.
    - Energy System Graph: Graph which shows the energy system model.
    - Result Table: Table which shows all components of the energy system model 
    with data like costs and emissions.
    - Interactive Results: Dashboard to analyse load profiles of the systems 
    components (e.g. electricity load profiles of a building).
    - *Coming soon: Building-specific results of a possible energy supply.*
2. In the multi-objective optimization the following results are displayed:
    - Pareto Diagram: Diagram which shows the costs and emissions of each 
    scenario (pareto point of the multi-objective optimization).
    - Energy quantity diagrams: Heat and electricity amount diagrams to show 
    the energy supply at each scenario 
    - All results described under 1 for each scenario
